Start the server: npm run server  

Start the client: npm run client

Access the website: https://localhost:3000  

The server randomly creates an array in terms of the input from the client. 
The client displays values of the received array by transforming 1 into white squares and 0 into black squares.
The white square means it is open for go through. The black square means it is closed.
The goal of the website is to use the algorithm of weightedQuickUnionUF to check if there is a path from the top to the bottom
